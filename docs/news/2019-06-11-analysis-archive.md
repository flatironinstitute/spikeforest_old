SpikeForest now has an analysis archive. You can click on the "Archive" link at
the top of the website and get a listing of the current analysis and all
previous analyses (as of a few days ago). Each entry is a snapshot of the entire
analysis, including the results of all sorters applied to all recordings, all
the input files, parameters, outputs, singularity containers, etc. Although it
seems like a lot of data, the actual snapshot is just a JSON file containing
`sha1://` and `sha1dir://` links to the larger files. It's sort of like an
index.

To download and explore the results of a particular analysis, first find the
desired file in the list and copy the `sha1://` path. Then load it into Python
(perhaps a notebook) as follows (substituting the path you copied of course):

```
from mountaintools import client as mt

mt.configDownloadFrom(['spikeforest.public'])
A = mt.loadObject(path='sha1://60d72c800e62b86afac17182fcd8c27f1d53d2fd/analysis.json')
```

You can explore the output using [this notebook](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikeforest/blob/master/working/notebooks/view_main_analysis.ipynb) (link will probably break in the future), 

You can also explore this JSON object directly. For example, to print some basic information:

```
print(A['General'])

print('\nSorters used:')
print([sorter['name'] for sorter in A['Sorters']])

print('\nStudy sets:')
print([study_set['name'] for study_set in A['StudySets']])
```

This outputs:

```
