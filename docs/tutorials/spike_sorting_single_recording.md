# Spike sorting a single recording

Here we describe how to run spike sorting on a single recording.

After installation, the below code may be run via [this python file](spike_sorting_single_recording.py).

## Prerequisites

At this point, SpikeForest has only been tested in Linux. In the future we will support OSX. It is also possible to use Linux within Windows.


## Installation

The first step is to install spikeforest and mountaintools. The easiest way is to use
the PyPI packages as follows.

```
pip install --upgrade spikeforest==0.11.0
pip install --upgrade mountaintools==0.7.1
```

To use the containerized versions of the spike sorters (recommended), you should
[install singularity 2.6.1](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps).
This will work for all of the non-Matlab spike sorters (in the future we will
also containerize the Matlab packages).

## Preparing a recording

<!--- #marker:5ee480a5-spikeforest-preparing-recordings-mda -->

To create a recording in .mda format (suitable for running SpikeForest sorters),
use the SpikeExtractors package, which will be installed as part of the
SpikeForest installation. For more information, see
[SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/).

For purpose of illustration here is a quick way to generate a test recording in .mda format:

```python
import os
import shutil
from spikeforest import example_datasets
from spikeforest import SFMdaRecordingExtractor, SFMdaSortingExtractor

recording, sorting_true = example_datasets.toy_example1() 

recdir = 'toy_example1'

# remove the toy recording directory if it exists
if os.path.exists(recdir):
    shutil.rmtree(recdir)

print('Preparing toy recording...')
SFMdaRecordingExtractor.write_recording(recording=recording, save_path=recdir)
SFMdaSortingExtractor.write_sorting(sorting=sorting_true, save_path=recdir + '/firings_true.mda')


```

## Running the sorting

In the future we will be able to perform the following operations directly using the
extractor objects. But at this point, we operate on directories.

```python
# import a spike sorter from the spikesorters module of spikeforest
from spikesorters import MountainSort4
import os
import shutil

# In place of MountainSort4 you could use any of the following:
#
# MountainSort4, SpykingCircus, KiloSort, KiloSort2, YASS
# IronClust, HerdingSpikes2, JRClust, Tridesclous, Klusta
# although the Matlab sorters require further setup.

# clear and create an empty output directory (keep things tidy)
if os.path.exists('test_outputs'):
    shutil.rmtree('test_outputs')
os.makedirs('test_outputs', exist_ok=True)

# Run spike sorting in the default singularity container
print('Spike sorting...')
MountainSort4.execute(
    recording_dir=recdir,
    firings_out='test_outputs/ms4_firings.mda',
    detect_sign=-1,
    adjacency_radius=50,
    _container='default'
)

# Load the result into a sorting extractor
sorting = SFMdaSortingExtractor(firings_file='test_outputs/ms4_firings.mda')
```

When using MountainTools processors (via `execute()`), results are
automatically cached. To force rerun, use the `_force_run=True` option.

As mentioned in the comments above, you can use any of the SpikeForest-wrapped
sorting algorithms in place of MountainSort4.

## Comparison with ground truth

Next, we can compare the result with ground truth

```python
# import from the spikeforest package
import spikeforest_analysis as sa

# write the ground truth firings file
SFMdaSortingExtractor.write_sorting(
    sorting=sorting_true,
    save_path='test_outputs/firings_true.mda'
)

# run the comparison
print('Compare with truth...')
sa.GenSortingComparisonTable.execute(
    firings='test_outputs/ms4_firings.mda',
    firings_true='test_outputs/firings_true.mda',
    units_true=[],  # use all units
    json_out='test_outputs/comparison.json',
    html_out='test_outputs/comparison.html',
    _container=None
)

# we may also want to compute the SNRs of the ground truth units
# together with firing rates and other information
print('Compute units info...')
sa.ComputeUnitsInfo.execute(
    recording_dir=recdir,
    firings='test_outputs/firings_true.mda',
    json_out='test_outputs/true_units_info.json'
)

import numpy as np

# Load and consolidate the outputs
true_units_info = mt.loadObject(path='test_outputs/true_units_info.json')
comparison = mt.loadObject(path='test_outputs/comparison.json')
true_units_info_by_unit_id = dict()
for unit in true_units_info:
  true_units_info_by_unit_id[unit['unit_id']] = unit
for unit in comparison.values():
  unit['true_unit_info'] = true_units_info_by_unit_id[unit['unit_id']]
  
# Print SNRs and accuracies
for unit in comparison.values():
  print('Unit {}: SNR={}, accuracy={}'.format(unit['unit_id'], unit['true_unit_info']['snr'], unit['accuracy']))
  
# Report number of units found
snrthresh = 8
units_above = [unit for unit in comparison.values() if float(unit['true_unit_info']['snr'] > snrthresh)]
print('Avg. accuracy for units with snr >= {}: {}'.format(snrthresh, np.mean([float(unit['accuracy']) for unit in units_above])))

```
