# SYNTH_MEAREC

## Recording
- Synthetic groundtruth generated by MEArec
- Recordings generated by Alessio Buccino and Jeremy Magland on Jul 5, 2019
- code is available on Github
  - run `https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikeforest/blob/master/working/simulations/mearec/create_MEArec_templates_spikeforest.py`
  - commit#: 6691a1b4701696fa6b9aab5294f34a53ebb9d65e
  - Spike templates are generated from Layer 5 cells of [Neocortical Micro Circuit Portal](https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/welcome)
  - Spike trains are generated by Poisson processes and spikes that violate a refractory period of 2ms are removed
  - Templates and spike trains are combined with a modulated convolution.
  - There are two types of modulation:
    - **without bursting**: spikes are only modulated in amplitude with a normal distribution (mean 1, std 0.05)
    - **with bursting**: spike trains are modulated depending on the ISI and templates are modulated in amplitude and 
    stretched in shape
- required packages
  - [MEArec](https://pypi.org/project/MEArec/)

## Electrodes

- SYNTH_MEAREC_TETRODE
    - Tetrode, linearly spaced, inter-electrode-distance 16um, square shape, 8um size

- SYNTH_MEAREC_NEURONEXUS
    - Neuronexus-32, Neuronexus A1x32-Poly3-5mm-25s-177-CM32 probe. 32 circular contacts (7.5um radius) in 3 staggered columns.
    The inter-electrode distance is 25um in the x- and 18um in the y-direction.

- SYNTH_MEAREC_NEUROPIXELS
    - Neuropixels-128, 128 square contacts (12um side length) in 4 staggered columns. 


## Directory naming convension: datasets_noise#_K#_C#
- noise#: noise value added (SD of white noise)
- K#: number of units simulated
- C#: number of electrodes (arranged linearly and separated by a 1 distance unit)
- _bursting: indicates recordings with bursting. Note that recordings with and without bursting share the same spiking activity.
